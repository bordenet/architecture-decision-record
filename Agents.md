# AI Agent Guidelines - architecture-decision-record

> **Generated by**: [golden-agents](https://github.com/bordenet/golden-agents) v1.4.0 (progressive)
> **Last Updated**: 2026-02-02
> **Languages**: javascript
> **Type**: general

Minimal core with on-demand module loading. Templates at: `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/`
<!-- GOLDEN:self-manage:start -->
## ⚠️ Before ANY Task
1. Load `.ai-guidance/invariants.md` — contains critical rules
2. After editing ANY guidance file, check: `wc -l Agents.md .ai-guidance/*.md 2>/dev/null`
   - `Agents.md` >150 lines → refactor into `.ai-guidance/`
   - Any `.ai-guidance/*.md` >50 lines → split into sub-directory

## Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

Before ANY commit:
1. **Lint**: `npm run lint`
2. **Build**: `npm run build`
3. **Test**: `npm test`
4. **Coverage**: Minimum 70%

**Order matters.** Lint → Build → Test. Never skip steps.

## Communication Rules

- **No flattery** - Skip "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- **No hype** - Avoid "revolutionary", "game-changing", "seamless"
- **Evidence-based** - Cite sources or qualify as opinion
- **Direct** - State facts without embellishment

**Banned phrases**: production-grade, world-class, leverage, utilize, incredibly, extremely, Happy to help!

## 🚨 Progressive Module Loading

**STOP and load the relevant module BEFORE these actions:**

### Language Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE writing ANY `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx` file**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/languages/javascript.md`

### Workflow Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE any commit, PR, push, or merge**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/security.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN tests fail OR after 2+ failed fix attempts**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/testing.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN build fails OR lint errors appear**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/build-hygiene.md`
- 🟡 **BEFORE deploying to any environment**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/deployment.md`
- 🟡 **WHEN conversation exceeds 50 exchanges**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/context-management.md`

### Optional: Superpowers integration

If [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is installed, run at session start:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

<!-- GOLDEN:framework:end -->

## Project-Specific Rules

**Status**: DEPRECATED - See docforge-ai for active development
**Live URL**: https://bordenet.github.io/architecture-decision-record/

### Reference Implementations
- **[product-requirements-assistant](https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant)** - Dark mode, 3-phase workflow
- **[one-pager](https://github.com/bordenet/one-pager)** - UI patterns

### Quick Reference
- **Setup**: `./scripts/setup-macos.sh`
- **Deploy**: `./scripts/deploy-web.sh`

## 📐 Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

**Key Rules**:
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, async/await)
- Double quotes for strings
- 2-space indentation
- Semicolons required
- Descriptive variable names (no single letters except loop counters)
- JSDoc comments for all functions
- Defensive coding (validate inputs, handle errors)

### Testing Standards
- ≥70% code coverage (≥85% for production apps)
- Test all public functions
- Test error cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

---

## 📝 Communication Style

### User Expectations
- **No flattery**: Don't say "great question", "excellent idea", etc.
- **Be direct**: Skip pleasantries, get to the point
- **Be specific**: "37/37 tests passing" not "tests are working"
- **Be proactive**: Always end with "What's left: [list]"

### Status Update Template
```
✅ Completed:
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]

✅ Quality Checks:
- Linting: PASSED (0 errors)
- Tests: PASSED (37/37)
- Coverage: 73% (exceeds 70% threshold)

✅ What's Left:
- [Specific remaining task 1]
- [Specific remaining task 2]
```

## Documentation Hygiene: Automatic Validation

**Problem**: Bootstrap projects accumulate documentation clutter over time - SESSION-CHECKPOINT files after work is complete, extensive "completed work" listings, references to deleted files. Developers have to manually remember to clean these up.

**Solution**: Automatic validation that runs on every commit and rejects commits containing:

- SESSION-CHECKPOINT.md files with no actual remaining work
- Extensive "✅ completed work" listings (indicates historical clutter)
- References to deleted files or directories
- CLAUDE.md files exceeding 600 lines (indicates accumulated cruft)
- TODO lists in projects marked as complete

**Implementation**: `scripts/lib/validate-docs.sh` (~188-line shell script that runs in <1 second).

**Benefit**: Documentation stays clean and focused without requiring manual enforcement. Developers get immediate feedback: "Remove that completed work section before you push."

**Where It Works**: All Genesis-bootstrapped projects - the script is generic enough to work for any documentation structure.

**Integration**:
- Pre-commit hook: Validates docs before commit
- CI/CD: Runs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to catch any bypassed hooks
- Template: Included in all Genesis-generated projects

**Usage**:
```bash
# Manual validation
./scripts/lib/validate-docs.sh

# Automatic validation (runs on git commit)
# No action needed - pre-commit hook handles it
```

**Common Fixes When Validation Fails**:
- Delete SESSION-CHECKPOINT.md if project is complete
- Remove ✅ completed work sections from documentation (move to CHANGELOG if needed)
- Update references to deleted files
- Remove TODO lists from completed projects
- Trim CLAUDE.md if it exceeds 600 lines
