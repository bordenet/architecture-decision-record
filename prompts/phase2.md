# Phase 2: Review & Critique - Architecture Decision Record Assistant

This phase involves external review of the initial ADR draft.

**What to do**:
1. Copy the Phase 1 draft to your preferred AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
2. Ask for critical feedback on:
   - Completeness of the decision
   - Validity of the context
   - Realism of the consequences
   - Strength of the rationale
3. Identify any missing considerations
4. Suggest improvements
5. Paste the feedback back here in Phase 3

**Sample feedback prompts**:

> "Review this ADR for completeness and provide critical feedback:"
> "Are the consequences realistic? What's missing?"
> "Is the rationale convincing? Suggest alternatives."
> "Does this decision align with modern best practices?"

---

**The reviewed ADR and feedback from external AI will be used in Phase 3 to synthesize the final version.**
