You are synthesizing an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) based on the original draft and critical feedback.

## Original ADR

{phase1_output}

## Critical Feedback Received

{phase2_review}

## Your Task

Create a final, polished ADR that:
1. Incorporates valid feedback from the review
2. Addresses weaknesses identified
3. Adds missing considerations
4. Strengthens the rationale
5. Maintains the core decision (unless feedback reveals fatal flaws)

## Output Format

Return a complete, final ADR in this format:

```markdown
## Title
[Refined title]

## Status
[Status: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded]

## Context
[Enhanced context incorporating feedback]

## Decision
[Refined decision statement]

## Consequences
[Comprehensive consequences including points from feedback]

## Rationale
[Strengthened rationale addressing reviewer concerns]

## Alternatives Considered
[Document alternatives mentioned in feedback]
```

The output should be production-ready markdown that can be committed to a repository.
