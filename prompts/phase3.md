You are synthesizing a final Architecture Decision Record (ADR) based on the original draft and critical feedback.

## Original ADR

{phase1_output}

## Critical Feedback Received

{phase2_review}

## Your Task

Create a final, polished ADR that:

1. Incorporates valid feedback from the review
2. Addresses weaknesses identified
3. Adds any missing elements
4. Maintains the standard ADR format (Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences)

## Output Format

Return a complete, final ADR in this format:

```markdown
# [Title]

## Status
[Status]

## Context
[Improved context incorporating feedback]

## Decision
[Refined decision that addresses feedback]

## Consequences
[Comprehensive list of positive AND negative consequences]
```

## Guidelines

1. Keep what works from the original
2. Fix what the review identified as weak
3. Add anything that was missing
4. Ensure consequences include BOTH positive and negative impacts
5. Make the final ADR production-ready for a repository

Return only the final ADR in markdown format.
