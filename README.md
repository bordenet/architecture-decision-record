Write Architecture Decision Records with AI. Three phases: draft, review, refine.

> **What is an ADR?** An Architecture Decision Record captures a significant architectural decision along with its context and consequences. ADRs document *why* a decision was made, not just *what* was decided. See [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io/) for the full specification.

## Quick Start

1. Open the [demo](https://bordenet.github.io/architecture-decision-record/)
2. Enter decision context, problem statement, and constraints
3. Copy prompt → paste into Claude → paste response back
4. Repeat for review (Gemini) and synthesis (Claude)
5. Export as Markdown

## What It Does

- **Draft → Review → Synthesize**: Claude writes, Gemini critiques, Claude refines
- **Browser storage**: Data stays in IndexedDB, nothing leaves your machine
- **No login**: Just open and use
- **Dark mode**: Toggle in the UI

## How the Phases Work

**Phase 1** — You provide decision context. Claude drafts an ADR with options and consequences.

**Phase 2** — Gemini reviews the draft: What alternatives are missing? What consequences are vague? What assumptions are unstated?

**Phase 3** — Claude takes the original draft plus Gemini's critique and produces a final ADR with clear tradeoffs.

## Scoring Methodology

The validator scores ADRs on a **100-point scale** across four equally-weighted dimensions aligned with the [ADR specification](https://adr.github.io/):

| Dimension | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Context | 25 |
| Decision | 25 |
| Consequences | 25 |
| Status | 25 |

The scoring enforces that ADRs document *why* a decision was made, not just *what* was decided. For complete methodology details including detection patterns, adversarial robustness, and calibration notes, see **[docs/Scoring_Methods.md](./docs/Scoring_Methods.md)**.

## Usage

1. Open the app
2. Click "New Project", fill in your inputs
3. Copy each phase's prompt to the appropriate AI, paste responses back
4. Export when done

**Mock mode**: On localhost, toggle "AI Mock Mode" (bottom-right) to skip the copy/paste loop. Useful for testing.
