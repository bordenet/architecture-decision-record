This addresses the 300% customer growth driving current deployment bottlenecks and team coordination overhead.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Reduces deployment time from 45 minutes to 5 minutes per service, eliminating synchronized release windows and production outage risks\n- Enables individual teams to scale services independently based on actual demand; order processing can scale 10x without scaling inventory\n- Allows domain teams to adopt appropriate technology stacks per domain; removes one-size-fits-all technology constraints\n- Reduces team wait times on shared infrastructure; teams no longer block each other on database schema changes or deployment coordination\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Requires implementing distributed systems patterns: eventual consistency replaces ACID transactions, requiring event-driven architecture and compensation logic\n- Increases network latency: inter-service calls add 50-100ms per hop, requiring caching strategies and circuit breakers throughout the system\n- Requires new expertise in message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), distributed tracing (Jaeger), and service mesh; estimated 6-8 weeks team training\n- Increases operational complexity: surface area grows from 1 deployment artifact to 10+, requiring Kubernetes orchestration and observability infrastructure",

Customer feedback shows frustration with performance.\n        Our team of 8 frontend developers spends 40% of time on bug fixes rather than features.\n        Modern frameworks offer better component reusability and testing support.\n\n## Decision\nWe will migrate our jQuery-based admin dashboard to React with TypeScript, establishing a component library shared across all frontend services. This addresses the 6-week onboarding time for new developers and reduces 40% of engineering time spent on bugs rather than features.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Reduces developer onboarding from 6 weeks to 2 weeks through component reusability and clear patterns\n- Enables automated testing: component test coverage increases from 0% to 80%+ within first quarter\n- Reduces bug-related work from 40% to 10% of sprint time through type safety (TypeScript) and component isolation\n- Improves performance: lazy-loading and bundle optimization reduce initial load from 8s to 2s\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Requires React and TypeScript expertise; team needs 4-week ramp-up period before productive at target velocity\n- Migration effort is 6-8 weeks for existing features; requires parallel implementation to avoid downtime\n- Increases build infrastructure complexity with new toolchain (webpack/Vite) and dependency management overhead\n- Requires npm ecosystem security practices; developers need training on managing transitive dependencies",

This addresses 12 security vulnerabilities from inconsistent auth and enables mandated multi-factor authentication across all services.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Reduces security vulnerabilities from 12 OWASP findings to 0 by eliminating session cookie handling bugs replicated across services\n- Enables consistent password policy and MFA enforcement across all services; compliance audits now straightforward\n- Simplifies user credential management: one password reset, one MFA enrollment enables access across all services\n- Allows security team to perform one comprehensive review instead of auditing eight separate implementations\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Requires implementing single point of failure protection: authentication service outage blocks all dependent services; needs 99.99% SLA\n- Increases authentication latency: every user request requires round-trip to auth service; requires aggressive token caching strategy\n- Requires rewriting authentication flows in 8 different services; estimated 4-6 weeks engineering effort for coordinated rollout\n- Requires new dependency on third-party identity provider (Okta, Auth0); adds $3-5k monthly cost and integration complexity",
