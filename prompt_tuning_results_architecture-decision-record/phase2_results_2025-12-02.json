This addresses the 300% customer growth that has made our current monolith unable to scale beyond deployments every 45 minutes, requiring coordinated releases across all services.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Reduces deployment time from 45-minute coordinated releases to 5-minute per-service deployments, eliminating production outage risk from cascading failures in single deployments\n- Enables independent scaling: order-processing microservice handles peak traffic at 10x load without scaling inventory or shipping services, reducing infrastructure costs\n- Allows domain teams to choose appropriate technology stacks and databases for their specific domain problems; removes monolithic technology constraints\n- Reduces inter-team dependencies: teams deploy, scale, and debug independently without blocking on other teams' database schema changes or deployment windows\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Requires implementing event-driven architecture with message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for data consistency across domains; ACID transactions become impossible and teams must implement compensation logic instead\n- Introduces significant network latency: inter-service calls add 50-100ms per hop; requires circuit breakers, bulkheads, and extensive caching strategies throughout the system\n- Demands expertise in distributed systems, observability, and service meshes; current team requires 6-8 weeks of structured training on eventual consistency, distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin), and Kubernetes\n- Increases operational surface area from 1 deployment artifact to 10+ services; requires investment in containerization, service mesh infrastructure (Istio), and comprehensive monitoring across all services",

The codebase has no tests.\n        We're losing features to competitors with better UX. Customer feedback shows frustration with performance.\n        Our team of 8 frontend developers spends 40% of time on bug fixes rather than features.\n        Modern frameworks offer better component reusability and testing support.\n\n## Decision\nWe will migrate our jQuery-based admin dashboard to React with TypeScript, establishing a shared component library (Storybook) used across all four frontend services. This directly addresses the 6-week onboarding time for new frontend developers and the 40% of engineering time lost to frontend bugs rather than feature development.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Reduces developer onboarding from 6 weeks to 2 weeks by providing reusable, well-documented components and consistent patterns across all frontend applications\n- Enables comprehensive automated testing: component test coverage increases from 0% to 80%+ in first quarter through Jest + React Testing Library; integration testing becomes feasible\n- Reduces bug-related work from 40% to 10% of sprint velocity through TypeScript type safety preventing runtime errors and React component isolation preventing state leaks\n- Improves frontend performance: bundle optimization and code-splitting reduce initial page load from 8s to 2s; lazy-loading reduces time-to-interactive from 12s to 4s\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Requires React and TypeScript expertise; team's current jQuery experts need 4-week intensive training before meeting target code velocity\n- Migration effort spans 6-8 weeks of parallel development; requires maintaining both jQuery and React codebases simultaneously to avoid user-facing downtime\n- Increases build infrastructure complexity with new toolchain (Webpack/Vite), module bundling, and npm dependency management; developers must understand tree-shaking and code-splitting concepts\n- Introduces npm ecosystem security risks; team must implement dependency scanning (Snyk/Dependabot), manage transitive dependencies, and perform quarterly security audits",

Compliance requires we retain data for 7 years.\n        We're running out of disk space despite aggressive archiving.\n        Data structure is mostly key-value pairs with variable attributes.\n        Current quarterly costs are $150k for database infrastructure alone.\n\n## Decision\nWe will migrate our 500GB relational database containing primarily unstructured operational logs to a time-series database (InfluxDB or Prometheus), implementing rolling retention that keeps raw data for 30 days and only aggregated metrics beyond that. This solves the $150k quarterly storage cost and 30-minute analytics query latencies that block business decision-making.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Reduces storage costs from $150k quarterly to $37.5k quarterly through compression and intelligent retention policies, achieving 75% savings on database infrastructure\n- Improves analytics query performance from 30 minutes to 30 seconds for typical reports through columnar storage and native time-series optimization\n- Enables real-time operational dashboards and automated alerts by supporting sub-second queries on recent data (last 24 hours), allowing immediate detection of system anomalies\n- Enforces automatic compliance with data deletion regulations (GDPR, CCPA) through granular, policy-based retention that requires no manual intervention\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Requires zero-downtime migration of 500GB of data; dual-write period during migration increases database load by 20%, requiring temporary capacity upgrade\n- Requires analytics team retraining on time-series query semantics: traditional JOIN operations become impossible; data model must restructure around time-series events rather than relational schemas, estimated 3-4 weeks learning curve\n- Eliminates relational capabilities: complex analytics queries requiring JOINs cannot be performed; historical analysis becomes difficult after 30-day retention window\n- Increases operational complexity if self-hosted: time-series database clustering, replication, and backup procedures differ significantly from relational databases; requires managed service ($5-10k/month) or dedicated ops expertise",

This resolves 12 OWASP authentication vulnerabilities from inconsistent implementations and enables mandatory multi-factor authentication across all services.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Eliminates 12 OWASP authentication vulnerabilities by consolidating session management, password handling, and credential validation into a single, audited service; reduces security review burden from eight separate implementations to one\n- Enables organization-wide password policy, MFA enforcement, and conditional access rules; compliance audits become straightforward and repeatable\n- Simplifies user experience: single password reset and single MFA enrollment grants access to all eight services; eliminates the cognitive load of managing eight separate credentials\n- Reduces ongoing security maintenance burden: security team performs one quarterly review instead of auditing eight implementations; patches to auth logic apply globally\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Creates single point of failure: authentication service outage immediately blocks all dependent services; requires 99.99% uptime SLA and comprehensive disaster recovery plan with real-time failover\n- Increases authentication latency: every user request requires round-trip to auth service (50-150ms added latency); requires aggressive token caching strategy and offline-capable UI patterns\n- Requires rewriting authentication flows in eight services; estimated 4-6 weeks engineering effort for coordinated rollout with zero-downtime migration using token translation\n- Introduces external dependency on managed identity provider: adds $3-5k monthly cost, vendor lock-in, and integration complexity; requires new OAuth implementation in all service clients",
