This addresses the 300% customer growth that has made our monolith unable to scale beyond 45-minute deployments, enabling horizontal scaling and independent team delivery.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Reduces deployment time from 45-minute coordinated releases to 5-minute per-service deployments, eliminating production outage risk from cascading failures\n- Enables independent scaling: order-processing microservice handles peak traffic at 10x load without scaling inventory or shipping services, reducing infrastructure costs\n- Allows domain teams to choose appropriate technology stacks and databases for their specific domain problems; removes monolithic technology constraints\n- Reduces inter-team dependencies: teams deploy, scale, and debug independently without blocking on other teams' database schema changes or deployment windows\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Requires implementing event-driven architecture with message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for data consistency across domains; ACID transactions become impossible and teams must implement compensation logic instead\n- Introduces significant network latency: inter-service calls add 50-100ms per hop; requires circuit breakers, bulkheads, and extensive caching strategies throughout the system\n- Demands expertise in distributed systems, observability, and service meshes; current team requires 6-8 weeks of structured training on eventual consistency, distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin), and Kubernetes\n- Increases operational surface area from 1 deployment artifact to 10+ services; requires investment in containerization, service mesh infrastructure (Istio), and comprehensive monitoring across all services\n\n### Subsequent ADRs Triggered by This Decision\n- Service mesh selection (Istio vs. Linkerd for inter-service communication and observability)\n- Distributed tracing implementation (Jaeger vs. Zipkin vs. Datadog)\n- API gateway and edge routing strategy (Kong vs. Ambassador vs. Envoy)\n\n### Recommended Review Timing\nReview at day 30 to validate 5-minute deployment target, measure inter-service latency, and assess team training progress.",

The codebase has no tests.\n        We're losing features to competitors with better UX. Customer feedback shows frustration with performance.\n        Our team of 8 frontend developers spends 40% of time on bug fixes rather than features.\n        Modern frameworks offer better component reusability and testing support.\n\n## Decision\nWe considered Angular (steep learning curve, 8-week ramp-up) and Vue (smaller ecosystem), but will migrate our jQuery dashboard to React with TypeScript, establishing a shared component library (Storybook). This directly addresses the 6-week onboarding time and the 40% of time spent on bugs rather than features, bringing us to industry-standard frontend velocity.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Reduces developer onboarding from 6 weeks to 2 weeks by providing reusable, well-documented components and consistent patterns across all frontend applications\n- Enables comprehensive automated testing: component test coverage increases from 0% to 80%+ in first quarter through Jest + React Testing Library; integration testing becomes feasible\n- Reduces bug-related work from 40% to 10% of sprint velocity through TypeScript type safety preventing runtime errors and React component isolation preventing state leaks\n- Improves frontend performance: bundle optimization and code-splitting reduce initial page load from 8s to 2s; lazy-loading reduces time-to-interactive from 12s to 4s\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Requires React and TypeScript expertise; team's current jQuery experts need 4-week intensive training before meeting target code velocity\n- Migration effort spans 6-8 weeks of parallel development; requires maintaining both jQuery and React codebases simultaneously to avoid user-facing downtime\n- Increases build infrastructure complexity with new toolchain (Webpack/Vite), module bundling, and npm dependency management; developers must understand tree-shaking and code-splitting concepts\n- Introduces npm ecosystem security risks; team must implement dependency scanning (Snyk/Dependabot), manage transitive dependencies, and perform quarterly security audits\n\n### Subsequent ADRs Triggered by This Decision\n- Component library strategy (Storybook setup, versioning, and release practices)\n- State management approach (Redux vs. Zustand vs. React Context for shared state)\n- Frontend testing strategy (Jest + React Testing Library vs. Cypress for E2E)\n\n### Recommended Review Timing\nReview after first 3 quarterly releases to validate 2-week onboarding target and measure bug reduction from 40% to 10%.",

Compliance requires we retain data for 7 years.\n        We're running out of disk space despite aggressive archiving.\n        Data structure is mostly key-value pairs with variable attributes.\n        Current quarterly costs are $150k for database infrastructure alone.\n\n## Decision\nWe considered column-based relational databases (expensive for this scale, $200k+ annually) and aggressive archiving (doesn't solve query times), but will migrate to a time-series database implementing rolling retention: raw data for 30 days, aggregated metrics beyond. This solves the $150k quarterly cost and 30-minute query latencies blocking business decision-making.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Reduces storage costs from $150k quarterly to $37.5k quarterly through compression and intelligent retention policies, achieving 75% savings on database infrastructure\n- Improves analytics query performance from 30 minutes to 30 seconds for typical reports through columnar storage and native time-series optimization\n- Enables real-time operational dashboards and automated alerts by supporting sub-second queries on recent data (last 24 hours), allowing immediate detection of system anomalies\n- Enforces automatic compliance with data deletion regulations (GDPR, CCPA) through granular, policy-based retention that requires no manual intervention\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Requires zero-downtime migration of 500GB of data; dual-write period during migration increases database load by 20%, requiring temporary capacity upgrade\n- Requires analytics team retraining on time-series query semantics: traditional JOIN operations become impossible; data model must restructure around time-series events rather than relational schemas, estimated 3-4 weeks learning curve\n- Eliminates relational capabilities: complex analytics queries requiring JOINs cannot be performed; historical analysis becomes difficult after 30-day retention window\n- Increases operational complexity if self-hosted: time-series database clustering, replication, and backup procedures differ significantly from relational databases; requires managed service ($5-10k/month) or dedicated ops expertise\n\n### Subsequent ADRs Triggered by This Decision\n- Backup and disaster recovery strategy for time-series systems\n- Real-time alerting platform selection (Prometheus AlertManager vs. PagerDuty vs. Datadog)\n- Data retention and compliance automation tooling (Kubernetes CronJobs vs. managed service)\n\n### Recommended Review Timing\nReview at day 60 to validate cost savings against $37.5k quarterly target and query performance improvements from 30 minutes to 30 seconds.",

This resolves 12 OWASP vulnerabilities from inconsistent implementations and enables mandatory MFA across all services.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Eliminates 12 OWASP authentication vulnerabilities by consolidating session management, password handling, and credential validation into a single, audited service; reduces security review burden from eight separate implementations to one\n- Enables organization-wide password policy, MFA enforcement, and conditional access rules; compliance audits become straightforward and repeatable\n- Simplifies user experience: single password reset and single MFA enrollment grants access to all eight services; eliminates the cognitive load of managing eight separate credentials\n- Reduces ongoing security maintenance burden: security team performs one quarterly review instead of auditing eight implementations; patches to auth logic apply globally\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Creates single point of failure: authentication service outage immediately blocks all dependent services; requires 99.99% uptime SLA and comprehensive disaster recovery plan with real-time failover\n- Increases authentication latency: every user request requires round-trip to auth service (50-150ms added latency); requires aggressive token caching strategy and offline-capable UI patterns\n- Requires rewriting authentication flows in eight services; estimated 4-6 weeks engineering effort for coordinated rollout with zero-downtime migration using token translation\n- Introduces external dependency on managed identity provider: adds $3-5k monthly cost, vendor lock-in, and integration complexity; requires new OAuth implementation in all service clients\n\n### Subsequent ADRs Triggered by This Decision\n- Token caching strategy (in-memory vs. Redis vs. local browser storage)\n- Session timeout and token lifetime policies\n- Multi-tenancy and cross-organization access control patterns\n\n### Recommended Review Timing\nReview at day 14 to verify zero security incidents and measure authentication latency impact against 50-150ms assumption.",

This resolves 12 OWASP vulnerabilities from inconsistent implementations and enables mandatory MFA across all services.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Eliminates 12 OWASP authentication vulnerabilities by consolidating session management, password handling, and credential validation into a single, audited service; reduces security review burden from eight separate implementations to one\n- Enables organization-wide password policy, MFA enforcement, and conditional access rules; compliance audits become straightforward and repeatable\n- Simplifies user experience: single password reset and single MFA enrollment grants access to all eight services; eliminates the cognitive load of managing eight separate credentials\n- Reduces ongoing security maintenance burden: security team performs one quarterly review instead of auditing eight implementations; patches to auth logic apply globally\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- Creates single point of failure: authentication service outage immediately blocks all dependent services; requires 99.99% uptime SLA and comprehensive disaster recovery plan with real-time failover\n- Increases authentication latency: every user request requires round-trip to auth service (50-150ms added latency); requires aggressive token caching strategy and offline-capable UI patterns\n- Requires rewriting authentication flows in eight services; estimated 4-6 weeks engineering effort for coordinated rollout with zero-downtime migration using token translation\n- Introduces external dependency on managed identity provider: adds $3-5k monthly cost, vendor lock-in, and integration complexity; requires new OAuth implementation in all service clients\n\n### Subsequent ADRs Triggered by This Decision\n- Token caching strategy (in-memory vs. Redis vs. local browser storage)\n- Session timeout and token lifetime policies\n- Multi-tenancy and cross-organization access control patterns\n\n### Recommended Review Timing\nReview at day 14 to verify zero security incidents and measure authentication latency impact against 50-150ms assumption.",
