This allows each team to move at its natural pace\nwhile maintaining system cohesion through well-defined interfaces.\n\nWe are choosing this approach because it directly addresses our deployment bottlenecks and team coordination challenges,\nwhile being implementable within our current technical and organizational constraints.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- **Independent Deployment**: Each team can deploy on their own schedule without coordinating database changes\n- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Clear boundaries make the system easier to understand for new team members  \n- **Technology Autonomy**: Teams can adopt the right tool for their specific domain rather than standardizing globally\n- **Horizontal Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on actual demand patterns\n- **Faster Feature Development**: Teams no longer block each other on shared resource constraints\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- **Distributed System Complexity**: We now need to manage communication between services, adding failure modes\n- **Data Consistency Challenges**: Distributed transactions become harder; we need event-driven patterns\n- **Operational Overhead**: More services means more monitoring, logging, and alerting infrastructure\n- **Team Coordination Required**: Despite independence, teams still need to coordinate on interface changes and dependencies\n- **Network Latency**: Service-to-service communication introduces new performance considerations we don't have today",
